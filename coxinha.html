    <h2>What is a Coxinha?</h2>
    <p>
      Coxinha is a popular street food <u>snack</u> in <strong>Brazil</strong> and is fun and economical
      to make. Think of it as savory dough shaped into a drumstick with a creamy
      chicken salad filling. It's then battered and fried to golden, crispy
      perfection. They're easy to eat on the go, they're a meal unto themselves,
      they have a unique appearance (simulated drumstick or teardrop), and most
      importantly, they are deep-fried and delicious!</p>

        <h3>The secret to making the best coxinha</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium pot, heat olive oil, then sauté garlic and onions until soft and brown. Add shredded chicken, salt, and paprika (or cayenne pepper). Stir to incorporate.</li>
            <li>Transfer mixture into a bowl, add cream cheese and parsley. Mix well.</li>
            <li>In the same pot, add butter, chicken broth, and milk. Bring to a boil. Stir in flour until dough is formed.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a flat surface. Knead the dough while it is warm, but not hot.</li>
            <li>Pinch a piece of dough, about the size of a large egg, and roll into a ball. Using your hands, flatten the dough and spoon filling into the center. Wrap the dough into a pear shape and make sure there aren’t any holes.</li>
            <li>While heating a pot of oil to 350˚F/180˚C, dredge the dough in egg and panko, then deep-fry till golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Drain on a towel, or wire rack and serve immediately.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
