    <h3>What exactly is a Caipirinha you ask?</h3>
    <p>
      A caipirinha is a traditional Brazilian cocktail that is made with a mix
      of muddled limes, sugar, crushed ice, and cachaca. Cachaca, pronounced
      kashassa, is a popular Brazilian sugar cane liquor, similar to rum and
      aguardiente. Caipirinhas are one of those drinks that are amazingly simple
      and easy to make, yet many restaurants/bars (outside of Brazil) tend to
      mess it up. Of course, when a cocktail is very simple, it does require
      good quality ingredients.
    </p>
    <h3>What are the Ingredients you need to make a Caipirinha?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1-2 limes sliced in half lengthwise and the pith removed, can be cut in
        quarters after the pith is removed
      </li>
      <li>1-2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
      <li>2 ounces of cachaca</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of fresh lime juice - optional Crushed ice</li>
      <li>
        <u
          ><strong><em>To garnish</em></strong></u
        >
        Lime slices
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What are the instructions on how to make these delights?</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Either directly in a short glass or in a cocktail shaker, combine the
        lime halves or quarters with the sugar and use a muddler to gently crush
        and squeeze out the lime juice from the limes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cachaca and lime juice, stir or shake well. If using a cocktail
        shaker pour the drink, including the muddled limes, into a short glass
        with crushed ice. If making the drink directly in the glass, add crushed
        ice and stir.
      </li>
      <li>Serve immediately garnished with a lime slice</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Read this beacuse your probably already drunk!</h3>
    <p>
      Caipirinhas are very strong, the proportion of alcohol to the rest of
      ingredients is quite high, and it's a drink that needs to be sipped and
      enjoyed slowly. It's one of those drinks where you know you are drinking a
      real drink, the benefit is that unlike some fruity drinks where you barely
      taste the booze and therefore drink way too much, you know from the start
      that you probably shouldn't have too many (or do lol). There are also (in
      my opinion) certain places, like the beach, and certain meals, like
      feijoada (a heavy Brazilian bean dish), where caipirinhas are ideal. And
      obviously, any party to watch the Brazil World Cup is also a perfect place
      to enjoy a caipirinha, even more so if you haven't had one in a while, or
      want to try it for the first time. Btw I just recently learned i was
      cutting the limes the wrong way. Previously I was just quartering the
      limes or cutting into small pieces, my friend Renato Laranja taught me
      that the right way was to cut them half (lengthwise), remove the pith from
      the middle and either use the whole half or cut it into quarters. Mr.
      Laranja also told me that to make the caipirinhas extra refreshing you can
      add some additional lime juice to the drink when you are preparing it.
      Most caipirinhas are usually made using white or clear cachaca, but you
      can also use aged dark/gold cachaca. The dark cachaca is aged in barrels
      and has a richer and more intense flavor. I've made caipinhas with aged
      cachaca and have to say that I really enjoy the taste even more than the
      regular caipirinhas. I Love Caipirinhas!! Evoke the essence of Brazilian
      life and their “Alegria de vida”. Happy drinking!
